## Introduction
Insurance is a financial safety net that provides protection against unexpected events such as accidents, illnesses, property damage, and even loss of life. By paying a small premium, individuals and businesses can safeguard themselves from major financial burdens. In this article, we will explore the basics of insurance, its types, and how to choose the right policy.

## What Is Insurance?
Insurance is a contract between an individual (policyholder) and an insurance company. The policyholder pays regular premiums, and in return, the insurer provides financial coverage for specific risks. If an unfortunate event occurs, the insurance company compensates for the losses based on the policy terms.
